Changes in version 1.1-5

	2013/01/09 Ignacio Lopez-de-Ullibarri <ilu@udc.es>

	* R/zzz.R (.Last.lib): the function has been deleted and substituted by .onUnload().

	* R/zzz.R (.First.lib): the function has been deleted.

	* man/control.presmooth.Rd (arguments): in 'length.grid.ise', Simpson's rule is used instead of trapezium's rule.

Changes in version 1.1-4

	2012/11/20 Ignacio Lopez-de-Ullibarri <ilu@udc.es>

	* R/presmooth.R (control.presmooth): the 'trim' argument has been deleted.

	* R/presmooth.R (presmooth):  in the calls to 'isevect.c', the 'ise' component now is defined as either 'numeric(if(forh) le.bw.1*le.bw.2 else le.bw.1)' (with 'presmoothing= TRUE') or 'numeric(le.bw.1)'  (with 'presmoothing = FALSE'); the previous result, after being divided by 'n.boot', is saved in 'mise'; 'trim' component deleted from the returned list; the 'ise.array' object has been deleted.

	* R/presmooth.R (print.survPresmooth): the 'trim' component has been deleted.

	* man/control.presmooth.Rd (usage, arguments, value): the 'trim' argument and all the references to it have been deleted.

	* man/presmooth.Rd (value, examples): the 'trim' item has been deleted; an example has been corrected and slightly changed; a new example has been added.

	* man/print.survPresmooth.Rd (arguments): "trim" deleted from the text in the 'more' argument.

	* src/isevect.c: 'isev' now accumulates the sum of all the '*isecomp' (previously, all the values were saved).

	2012/11/07 Ignacio Lopez-de-Ullibarri <ilu@udc.es>

	* R/presmooth.R (presmooth): 'bw.selec' is now 'c("fixed", "plugin", "bootstrap")' instead of 'c("plugin", "bootstrap", "fixed")'; the previous change also induces changes in the management of 'n.bw.selec' (key for the conversion oldvalue -> new value: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1); when 'presmoothing == FALSE' and 'n.estimand %in% 1:2', 'fixed.bw' is set to 0.

	* man/presmooth.Rd (usage, arguments): Changes in 'bw.selec' (see above).

	2012/11/02 Ignacio Lopez-de-Ullibarri <ilu@udc.es>

	* DESCRIPTION: typing of the name of the first author and maintainer changed to 'Lopez de Ullibarri' (without hyphens).

	* R/presmooth.R (presmooth): due to a programming error, 'pilot.bw1' was not computed when 'bw.selec = "bootstrap"' and 'presmoothing = FALSE': the condition '((n.bw.selec == 1) & forh) | (n.bw.selec == 2 & presmoothing)' is replaced with '((n.bw.selec == 1) & forh) | (n.bw.selec == 2)'; the correction of the inputted values of 'grid.bw' and 'grid.bw.pil' are checked; in bootstrap bandwidth selection the computation of 'grid.bw.1' and 'grid.bw.2' when 'presmoothing = FALSE' is changed, and the arguments 'grid.bw.2' and 'le.bw.2' in the call to 'isevect' are replaced by 'grid.bw.1' and 'le.bw.1', resp.; the computation of'ise.array' is modified; for the bootstrap bandwidth, when computing 'bw' for f or h and 'presmoothing=FALSE', 'grid.bw.2' is replaced with 'grid.bw.1'; in 'ps', the component 'problem.pi' has been deleted from 'ps', and the components 'grid.pil' and 'grid.bw' have been modified; a logical variable, 'allcens', added for controlling the warnings printed when all data are censored.

	* R/presmooth.R (print.survPresmooth): 'problem.pi' removed from the 'comps' vector.

	* man/control.presmooth.Rd (author): typing of the name of the first author changed to 'Lopez de Ullibarri'.

	* man/presmooth.Rd (arguments, value, author): the description of the 'grid.bw.pil' and 'grid.bw' arguments have been rewritten; the 'problem.pi' component of the output has been deleted; typing of the name of the first author changed to 'Lopez de Ullibarri'.

	* man/print.survPresmooth.Rd (arguments, author): 'call' and 'bw.selec' removed from the set of valid names for the 'more' argument; typing of the name of the first author changed to 'Lopez de Ullibarri'.

	* man/pscheck.Rd (author): typing of the name of the first author changed to 'Lopez de Ullibarri'.

Changes in version 1.1-3

	2012/10/15 Ignacio Lopez-de-Ullibarri <ilu@udc.es>

	* R/presmooth.R (control.presmooth): the 'k' argument has been removed.

	* R/presmooth.R (print.survPresmooth): the call is printed by default; new argument 'long' added; the printed text now distinguishes between presmoothed and non-presmoothed estimates; for f or h estimation, the value of 'bound' is printed; components 'call', 'bw.selec', 'bandwidth', 'x.est', 'estimand' removed from 'ext.names'; the components printed by default cannot be printed twice; some other little modifications and minor bugs corrected.

	* R/presmooth.R (presmooth): 'k' (more precisely, 'control$k') has been removed; in the computation of 'bw' for the plug-in bandwidth of h, 'pilot.bw[-3]' is replaced with 'pilot.bw' in the call to 'constrOptim'; when computing the bootstrap bandwidth for f and h, an if-else is added in the computations for the 2nd pilot: the else arm gives Muller pilot as an alternative when all data are censored within the interval taken; the program stops if 'bw.selec' does not (partially) match with one of 'plug-in', 'bootstrap' or 'fixed'; when partial matching is present, the correct values of 'kernel', 'bound' and 'bw.selec' are calculated; now the value of 'bound' is also returned.

	* man/control.presmooth.Rd (usage, arguments, examples): 'k' has been removed; some retyping for improving the PDF manual.

	* man/print.survPresmooth.Rd (arguments, examples): more details on the argument 'more' are given; some retyping for improving the PDF manual.

	* man/presmooth.Rd (usage, examples): corrected a bug repeated several times in the examples ('seq' instead of 'by' as an argument to seq); 'grid.bw' changed when computing the 'hboot' object; '\ldots' replaced with '...'; the 'dboot2' object is not computed; the last plot is redone; some retyping for improving the PDF manual.

	2012/10/09 Ignacio Lopez-de-Ullibarri <ilu@udc.es>

	* R/presmooth.R (presmooth): when computing the plug-in bandwidth for S or H, if 'Q' and 'A' are 0 'bw' is set to 0; when all the times are censored a warning is printed and NA returned for both the selected bandwidth and the estimate; the maximum value for all the pilots is set to control$k*range.t; the definition of 'grid.bw.pil' is changed; since 'grid.bw.pil' is not needed for bootstrap bandwidth selection when 'presmoothing' is FALSE, the new condition for computing or returning this grid is 'if(((n.bw.selec == 1) & forh) | (n.bw.selec == 2 & presmoothing))'.

	* man/control.presmooth.Rd (arguments, details): the length of 'pilot.par.ini' is 8 instead 6 and an explanation of the meaning of each component is included.

	2012/10/07 Ignacio Lopez-de-Ullibarri <ilu@udc.es>

	* src/termsmisenopresmooth.c: new function similar to 'termsmise.c' for the case without presmoothing.

	* src/isevect.c: numerical integration is done with Simpson's rule, instead of trapezium rule. Some pointers (pnull, pnull2) are initialized, or the memory allocated to them freed, within the arm of the switch where they are used. A new if-else is added, the if arm for the old code, and the else arm for the case with presmoothing = FALSE.

	* src/simpson.c: the argument 'step' is deleted (the multiplication by step is now done outside the function). Also, the numerical constants are written with a decimal point (although this has no effect on the results).

	* R/presmooth.R (presmooth): new argument 'presmoothing' added, whose value is returned by the function; the 'mise' component of the output is redefined; when computing the plug-in and bootstrap bandwidths of f and h, an if-else controlled by the value of the argument 'presmoothing' is added; in the final computation of 'p', if 'bw[1]' is 0 'p' is set to 'as.numeric(dfr$d)'; for estimating S and H with either a plug-in or bootstrap bandwidth, if presmoothing is FALSE the case is treated as 'bw.selec = "fixed"' and 'fixed.bw = 0', and a warning is printed; in the computation of 'C1', 'C2', 'D1', 'D2' and 'A', the multiplication by 'step.plugin' is done outside the call to 'simpson.c'(for the changes in 'simpson.c', see below).

	* man/presmooth.Rd (usage, arguments, details): new argument 'presmoothing' added and its use is explained in the 'details' section;  typo corrected in details: the upper bound for the selected bandwidths is equal to the range of observed times.

	2012/09/06 Ignacio Lopez-de-Ullibarri <ilu@udc.es>

	* R/presmooth.R (presmooth): The NULL value of arguments 5, 6, 7 and, sometimes, 9 in the call to 'presmestim.c' is set to an arbitrary value of the type specified by the function declaration; also, in the call to 'isevect.c', the NULL for arguments 9 and 10 is substituted for 0. The warning 'passing an object of type NULL to .C is deprecated', appearing with versions >2.15.0, is thus avoided.
